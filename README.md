# Python Crash Course Learning Journey

## Background

Have tried learning to code several times but struggled to make significant consistent progress while working full-time in an unrelated field. More recently been "vibe coding" with decent results, but want to fully understand my code so I can maintain and upgrade it effectively.
Currently making a career change to software development and working on this full-time.

## Current Approach

Taking a structured approach to build solid fundamentals:
- Working through Python Crash Course 3rd Edition systematically  
- Focusing on understanding every concept deeply
- Building projects that demonstrate real comprehension
- No shortcuts or "magic" code I don't understand

## Learning Goals

- Master Python and OOP fundamentals
- Build a chess engine/learning app using these skills
- Create maintainable, extensible code I can confidently modify
- Use this foundation to pursue development opportunities

## Current Progress

### Chapter 9: Classes âœ…
- Restaurant/User/Admin classes with inheritance and composition
- Module organization and imports

### Chapter 10: Files âœ…
- File handling with pathlib and text processing
- Reading and manipulating large datasets (pi million digits)
- String operations: splitlines(), lstrip(), slicing
- Pattern searching in text data
- Working with Claude Code for interactive development and testing
- Writing to files with write_text() method
- User input collection and file persistence (Guest/GuestBook exercises)
- Exception handling: ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError
- Text analysis and word counting in large literature files
- Code simplification techniques (removing temporary variables)
- String replacement and manipulation methods
- JSON data storage with json.dumps() and json.loads()
- User data persistence across program runs (favorite number, user profiles)
- User verification and authentication patterns

### Chapter 11: Testing Your Code ðŸš§
- Introduction to pytest and unit testing
- Writing test functions and assertions
- Testing functions with pytest

## Next Steps
